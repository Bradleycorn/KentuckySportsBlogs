# KentuckySportsBlogs

An android app that aggregates stories about University of Kentucky Sports, mainly basketball and football. 

### Motivation

This app serves as my introduction and exploration of the Jetpack Compose declarative UI framework for Android.
The app is written entirely in compose using its core concepts and principles including Material Theming and Compose Navigation, among others.
